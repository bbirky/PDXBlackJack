# PDX Blackjack 

#### A game of Blackjack between the user and the computer.


## Project Overview

#### What are the major features of your web application? What problem
#### is it attempting to solve? What libraries or frameworks will you 
#### use?

####  Major feature of this web application will be the ability of the
#### user to play the game Blackjack against the computer. Will be using 
#### the Django framework, Vue, HTML, CSS, and API calls.
## Functionality

#### Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What 
#### will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? 
#### How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

#### The user will log into their profile, which will save their stats
#### and overall points. The user will be able to wager their points
#### on each hand, choose between a Hit, Stand, or Double Down.
